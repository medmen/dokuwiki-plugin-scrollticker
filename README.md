# dokuwiki-plugin-scrollticker
plugin that turns an unordered list into a scrolling newsticker

## how to use?
simply wrap an unordered list into the tags
`<scrollticker>
  * list-item
  * next-item
</scrollticker>`

besides ordinary lists, also lists generated by dokuwiki functions will work.
For example you could fetch a list with links to the last three items of a discussion from the discussion plugin:

`<scrollticker>
{{threads>*&count=3&skipempty&simplelist}}
</scrollticker>`

or you could fetch a list with links to the articles in namespace "news" tagged with "latest", using the tag plugin

`<scrollticker>
{{topic>news?latest}} 
</scrollticker>`

In fact, that was my main goal when i started this...
